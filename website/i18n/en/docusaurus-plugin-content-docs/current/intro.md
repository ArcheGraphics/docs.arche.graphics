# First entry to WebGPU

WebGPU is a new generation of cross-platform graphics API:
![WebGPU in Chrome](/img/tutorial/dawn-in-chrome.png)

He abstracts the underlying graphics API of the system into a unified graphics interface, and after forming DawnNative,
and then serialized by DawnWire, the ability to call modern graphics APIs in the browser, its performance, especially
computing shaders, and future possibilities. supported RayTracing, Bindless, and IndirectCommandBuffer all have very
strong imagination.

The emergence of WebGPU has made the graphics API go through Metal, Vulkan, and DX12, making it easier to develop
cross-platform graphics applications. This ease of use does not only refer to the Web level. At the Native level, using
Dawn can also make it easier to develop cross-platform graphics applications. In fact, there are three manifestations of
future WebGPU-based cross-platform applications:

1. Native: Develop cross-platform applications based on Dawn.
2. WebAssembly: Develop cross-platform applications based on Dawn, compile them with WebAssembly, and call them in the
   browser.
3. WebGPU: H5-based web cross-platform application.

Therefore, [Arche Graphics](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics) is based on WebGPU, respectively
developed [Arche-cpp](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/Arche-cpp)
and [Arche.js](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/Arche.js) two projects from C++ and TypeScript The two perspectives
jointly explore the design and implementation of WebGPU. There are differences between the two, but keep them as close
as possible in terms of API design.
**This makes the documents of this website, including the home page showing the C++ implementation of WebGPU, the online
interactions presented by Arche.js are all rendered by Arche.js, and in the subsequent discussion, the difference
between the two languages ​​will be compared to show This showcases some design considerations for WebGPU. **

## Getting started

You can choose from the C++ based [Arche-cpp](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/Arche-cpp)
Get started with WebGPU with [Arche.js](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/Arche.js) based on TypeScript.

### [Arche-cpp](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/Arche-cpp)

Arche-Cpp uses Xcode for development, and Cmake will be added later Build support, because it is based on C++, it is
very easy to integrate graphics libraries in the existing C++ ecosystem, such as PhysX and Ozz-Animation. The entire
project is developed based on Git-Submodule, so all the code can be pulled at one time:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/Arche-cpp.git
````

After pulling the code, compile the third-party dependencies through the third-party script:

```bash
cd third-party && ./build.sh
````

Finally, open the Xcode project and compile the code.

### [Arche.js](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/Arche.js)

Arche.js uses Monorepo to manage projects and does not contain application scripts. If you want to develop quickly, you
can use [create-arche-app](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/create-arche-app)
Engineering Scaffolding:

```bash
npm init @arche-engine/arche-app
````

Or clone [Playground](https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/playground) directly:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ArcheGraphics/playground
````

The playground project is also generated by the create-arche-app scaffold and contains a series of examples. If you want
to modify the engine and test it, you can use the `npm link` command to connect:

```bash
npm link ../Arche.js/packages/* --no-package-lock
````
